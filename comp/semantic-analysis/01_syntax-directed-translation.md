# Syntax-Directed Translation

A **Syntax-Directed Definition (SDD, 语法制导定义)** is a context-free grammar together with attributes and rules.
- Attributes are asscociated with grammar symbols.
- Rules are associated with productions.

Two kinds of attributes for nonterminals:
- **Synthesized Attribute**
- **Inherited Attribute**
